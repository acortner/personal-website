                Here is a more visual representation for some of the front-end work I have done. Most of the work was done with HTML and CSS, while some projects also involved JavaScript, R, and PHP.

            <h2>NUvention &mdash; Web & Media</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the course of my NUvention class, I worked with a team on two projects aiming to 
                elevate the Chicago local music scene. The goal of the first project was made impossible due
                to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our team decided to switch gears and pursue a new project that
                would be more conducive to a virtual world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following video shows our initial project, which was a project management software for local venues and agents in order to
                ease the process of booking artists and planning shows at smaller venues. We worked primarily
                with the owner of the Montrose Saloon, a bar in the Montrose neighborhood of Chicago with live
                music every night, to determine his needs and desires, since he would theoretically have been
                a super-user of the application we were developing. The video shows the process of adding a new event
                and booking an artist with the software.

            <p>
                This net video shows a quick demo of our second project. The goal of the second project was to
                allow lesser-known Chicago artists advertise their virtual concerts in a space dedicated to them.
                On sites like Instagram and Facebook, they could only realistically reach their current following,
                so this site aimed to pull all of Chicago's local music fans together to help them discover new artists
                and help the artists increase their reach. The video shows the user-facing process for an artist
                to add their show to the site.

            <h2>Remote Desktop Shiny Application</h2>
            <p>This application was created so users would have a way to view the availability of the Remote Desktops within the ERISOne cluster in the Partners HealthCare network. To see the codebase, check out the <a href="https://github.com/acortner/remote_desktop_application" target="_blank">repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
            <p>There are three python scripts in this repository. The <em>rd_caps.py</em> script creates a secure shell with every remote desktop and finds the maximum user capacity, then inserts this information into a SQL database. The <em>rd_usage.py</em> script similarly creates a secure shell with every desktop, and it sends a list of all the active users to a SQL database. This script is run in the server every 5 minutes as a cronjob to constantly update the application. Lastly, the <em>rd_data.py</em> takes all the infromation from the SQL database, and exports it into an easily-accessible JSON file for the R application to reference.</p>
            <p>The R application is built using the Shiny library, which creates a clean and simple user interface with a <em>ui.R</em> file that lays out the elements similarly to HTML and a <em>server.R</em> file that handles the transfer of data from the JSON file into the UI. The video below shows the application being run from the server, featuring the live data, and it shows the simple interface as well as the responsiveness of the dashboard.</p>

            <h2 id="digfridge">CS330 &mdash; Digital Fridge</h2>
            <p>This application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using jQuery frameworks. It was built as the term project for a course in Human Computer Interaction. It is a basic prototype with no back-end infrastructure, designed to simply demonstrate an understanding of web-development and graphic design fundamentals. Feel free to go check out the <a href="https://github.com/food-waste/digital-fridge" target="_blank">repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
            <p>I built this application along with a team of three others. This application went through several phases of prototyping before we arrived at our final design. The dataset in the application is static since it is stored as a JavaScript variable, but the list is mutable, so the items can be changed or deleted, as shown in the video below.</p>

            <h2>Digital Health Review Image Map</h2>
            <p>This image map was creating using exclusively HTML and CSS in order to function properly on the Partners IS website. It is a complex hierachy of HTML elements, all styled by CSS in order to give them specific shapes and colors.</p>
            <p>The dynamic behavior of the page is all controlled by the CSS <em>hover</em> attribute.</p>

            <p>Similar to the previous image map, this image map is comprised solely of HTML and CSS, and it also includes SVG vectorized images in order to have the irregular arrow shapes. The rest of the shapes were created using CSS.</p>
