                My name is Andrew Cortner, and I am a senior at Northwestern University 
                majoring in computer science. I am originally from the Boston area, but I am 
                currently based in Chicago. I have developed a lot of front-end experience 
                during my academic career, focusing on web development and various web frameworks. 
                My internships, in addition to my coursework, have also helped me gain valuable 
                back-end experience, and I feel confident to take on any type of programming 
                project. I am open to work in any location, and I prefer an environment 
                where I get to work with a team to develop dynamic and exciting projects.
            </p>

                I am looking for a software engineering internship to broaden my horizons 
                and give me some valuable experience that will help me succeed in this 
                rapidly-growing field.
            </p>
