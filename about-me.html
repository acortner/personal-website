                My name is Andrew Cortner, and I am a sophomore at Northwestern University 
                majoring in computer science. I am originally from the Boston area, but I am 
                currently based in Chicago. I am really interested in the intersection between 
                computer programming and graphic design, and I prefer a work environment where 
                I get to work with a team to develop dynamic and visually intriguing front-end 
                computer interfaces. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am looking for a software engineering internship to broaden my horizons 
                and give me some valuable experience that will help me succeed in this 
                rapidly-growing field. I am available to work anywhere in the Greater 
                Boston Area or Greater Chicago area during the summer.
            </p>
